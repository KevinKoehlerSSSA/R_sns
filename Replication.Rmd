# Introduction {#Intro}

Does counterbalancing--the creation of alternative security forces outside of the military chain of command--decrease the risk of military coups? In this document, we replicate the analysis in @debruin2017, focusing in particular on the descriptive analysis in Tables 1 (p. 9) as well as the models in Table 2 (p. 13) and 3 (p. 14). 

This report is structured as follows. Section \ref{hypo} briefly reports the hypotheses developed in @debruin2017. Section \ref{data} describes the data (available [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022002717692652)). This section also reproduces the descriptive analysis in Table 1 of the original article (Section \ref{descr}). Section \ref{logit} estimates the regression models in Table 2 and some of the models in Table 3. In Section \ref{concl}, we conclude by summarizing the results of our replication.

# The hypotheses {#hypo}

@debruin2017 develops the following hypotheses based on existing research on military coups:

> **Hypothesis 1**: Coups are more likely to succeed against regimes that do not
counterbalance than those that do.

> **Hypothesis 1a**: Counterbalancing decreases the probability a coup will suc-
ceed by creating barriers to communication and coordination between forces.

> **Hypothesis 1b**: Counterbalancing decreases the probably a coup will succeed by
increasing the likelihood that coup plotters will face armed resistance to the coup.

> **Hypothesis 2**: Counterbalancing does not decrease the likelihood of coup
attempts.

> **Hypothesis 3**: The creation of a new counterweight increases the risk of a
coup in the following year.


# The data {#data}


## Descriptive analysis {#descr}

In this section, we reproduce Table 1 in the original article. There is a STATA do-file (`esd_preventingcoups_dofile.do`) which contains the STATA code for the table. Here are the contents: 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
*MAIN TEXT TABLES*
*Table 1: Counterbalancing and Coups
tab attempt cbcount
tab attempt newcb
tab success cbcount
tab success newcb
```

# Models {#logit}

Table 3 shows the models from @debruin2017, Table 2. 


## Marginal effects {#marg}

The Average Marginal Effect (AME) gives the change in the predicted probability of a successful coup for a one-unit increase in the independent variable. The figure below plots the AME for all variables in Model 3, along with 90, 95, and 99% confidence intervals.
